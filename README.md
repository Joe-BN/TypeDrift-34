( *I'll add an image once done* )

Plane and simple split mechanical keyboard based on the Esp32-C3

Using the C3 since it is available in my country
<br>
Finding it hard to get software to configure it, so I'll build my own
<br>
How hard can it really be ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll document the project as best I can
<br>
Feel free to use and modify the  files and programs that will be here.
