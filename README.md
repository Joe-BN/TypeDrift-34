A 34-key keyboard running on the Esp32-C3 microcontroller
<br> ( 3 x 5 + 2 )

The decision to use the Esp32-C3 is because I can utilize the power of the Esp-NOW protocal at a cheap price.
<br>
However, mainstream firmwares ( to my knowledge at the time of starting this project) have little to no support for this platform and available firmware is either out of date or really limited in functionality. 

So ... I'll build **my own**, ground-up.
<br>
How hard can it really be ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
I plan to document the code and thought processes as best I can.

Feel free to use and modify the  files and programs that will be here.
