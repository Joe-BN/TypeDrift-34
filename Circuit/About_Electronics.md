## Circuit âš¡
This folder contains the **Circuit** files for the keyboad in this project and even some *[pictures](Joe-BN/TypeDrift-34/Circuit/images)* taken in the process of designing and making the circuitry.

I decided I want to experience both hand wiring and pcb design.
<br>
So... I'll do both:
- pcb to hold and connect the type-C ports and the microcontroller
- handwiring the keyboard matrix

(Remember you don't have to follow the same path, and can still fully handwire the board ðŸ˜„)

I desided to use [KiCAD]() to design my PCBs and Circuits.

For those who want to have a go at creating their own PCBs, take a look at these resources:
